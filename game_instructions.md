# Definitions
A chain is a set of like-colored, orthogonally adjacent stones.
A region is a set of orthogonally adjacent empty points completely surrounded by stones or board edges. If all those points are orthogonally adjacent to at least two stones, said region is also a territory.
# Play
Black plays first, then turns alternate. On his turn, a player must place one stone of his color on an empty point.
Then, every territory on the board is filled with stones of the player who has the majority of stones orthogonally adjacent to it, after which the turn ends. Territories with the same number of Black and White stones adjacent to it are filled with stones of the opponent's color.
At the end of a turn, any two like-colored, diagonally adjacent stones must share at least one orthogonally adjacent, like-colored neighbor. Otherwise, the move is illegal and the player must choose another one.
If a player can't make a move on his turn, he must pass. Passing is otherwise not allowed. There will always be a move available to at least one of the players.
The game is won by the player who completes a chain of his color touching the two opposite board edges of his color. Draws are not possible.
# Pie rule
The pie rule is used in order to make the game fair. This means that White will have the option, on his first turn only, to change sides instead of making a regular move.
